# Getting started
### For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Look through existing issues and pull requests to check if someone else is already working on it
>    - We use `someone working on it` label to mark such issues.
>2. Fork, and do your changes
>    - Ensure you have followed the code style for the project.
>    - Ensure your commits are descriptive, as described in *"Committing Your Changes"*, below.
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
>    - Send a pull request, as described in *"Submitting Pull Requests"*, below.


### For small or "obvious" fixes:

> Help with the following by simply commenting directly on a pull request, or submitting a new one, as described above:
>* Spelling or grammar fixes
>* Comment/style/whitespace clean up
>* Adding log/debug messages
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files, .gitignore, etc.

# Submitting Pull Requests

### Staying in-sync with upstream:

> With your local feature branch checked out:
>* Keep your local `develop` branch pointing to the upstream `develop` branch
>    * `git remote add upstream https://github.com:philips-software/SmartSleep-Analyzer-SampleApp-Android.git`
>    * `git fetch upstream`
>    * `git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/develop develop`
>* Pull `develop` into your feature branch, and resolve any conflicts
>     * `git pull upstream develop`
>* Take a look at [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) for more info.

### Submitting your Pull Request:

> Once you are in-sync with `develop`, and any conflicts are resolved:
>* Double check any tests still pass
>* Ensure your changes still work as designed
>* Push your fork'd changes
>* Submit a Pull Request to *our* `develop branch!
